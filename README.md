# Water Hot Plot: Fine-Scale Water Quality Visualization with Plotnine
### 2024 Plotnine Competition Submission
author: Cameron Roberts

Please see here for my submission to the 2024 Plotnine competition:

I've found some practical utility in the use of this heatmap to display and interpret nitrate probe data from our water quality monitoring network. I also enjoy the colour scheme and the story it demonstrates where the onset of the wet season in north Queensland is the greatest driver of in-stream nitrate-N concentration rise. While also highlighting interesting impacts at certain sites outside of expectations. 

I hope you like it.
